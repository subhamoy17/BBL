						<p>A health assessment is a set of tests and examinations that give you an overview of your current health. You might choose to have a health assessment because of a specific health concern, or youâ€™d like support to improve your health. These health checks will be carried out by trained health advisers and nurses. With most of our assessments you will spend quality time with a Bupa doctor going through your results.</p>
